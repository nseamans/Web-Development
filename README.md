<h2>Major and Minor Triad Application</h2>
<p>
An exercise in designing an app that allows a user to choose a root key and a scale based on a triad to display the corresponding 
keys and a recommended accompanying chord. This was designed to help musical novices in looking up triads (three concurrent music notes). 
Something worth noting is that the highlighted keys correspond based on the color that several classical composers associated with 
that key.
