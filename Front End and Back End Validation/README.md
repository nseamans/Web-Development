<h3>Explination</h3>
<p>
This project represents typical validation on an internet form. This includes clientside and serverside validation. WHy have I done this? Having clientside validation can limit the amount of requests to the server. The server side validation is include in the event that that form data makes it paste the uses website (mainly for security). Once all of the rules rule as true, the query is submitted to a a database entitled test. Error messages are displayed if the record cannot be added to the database.

<h4>Practices of note:</h4>
<p>
1) Becuase it is easier to work with, I have developed this with the aid of XAMPP. This is a service that allows development for several server side plateforms on a single machine. This the stock log in information is used. I realize the security risk of keeping a user named root. This project was developed strictly to showcase my ability to validate and submit data to a database. I have included the queries to create the tables in the "test" database as needed.
